^^ I put these SOCs in emily's code.

```

```{r}
#hs_stem_creds <- hs_stem_creds %>% select(SOC, Cert = Certification.Name)

Health Sciences graph instead of nursing

For Health sciences, cybersecurity, manu we will have stem/stw


```{r}

```

```{r}

Vicki: "Occupation clusters include occupations from different major occupation groups."

So, I should join this to the bigger DF and then I can make a drop down?

```{r}
unique(all_df$`Code`[all_df$`Career Cluster` == "Manufacturing"])
```


```{r}
table(d$SOC %in% all_df$Code)
table(d$SOCNAME %in% all_df$Occupation)
```

```{r}
test <- substr(all_df$Code, start = 1, stop = 7)
```

```{r}
table(d$SOC %in% test)
```
